Repo for AoC 2023

Yo, back at it, but not really certain how far I'm going to be getting "through" it this year.

Entire repo will be in Python.  I'm going to try my hand at using some actions/automation this year to test my code in github against data hosted privately in S3 since Topaz does not want the AoC puzzle inputs publicly hosted.

Happy Honda-days and a merry Toyotathon to all.
